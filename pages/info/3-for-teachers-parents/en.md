# ðŸ¤¼ For Teachers, Parents, and Other Student Helpers

This application is designed so that anyone can act as a "teacher," even if they don't know English. We will refer to this person as the "Helper."

To allow the Helper to check the Student's results, regardless of their own English knowledge, we have added transcriptions in Russian letters for all words and sentences. You can also click on Russian phrases to hear them in English. And tell the Student: correct/incorrect.

# How the Helper checks the Student:

1. "Put away all hints (phone, laptop, etc.) and quickly translate what I say in Russian into English."
2. The Helper says word translations in random order, and the student quickly says them in English.
3. If the student hesitates or stumbles on certain words - the helper points out that the words are poorly learned. If it's very poor, the lesson can be stopped and the student sent to relearn.
4. After successfully reciting the words, the helper randomly says phrases from the "Translation" section, and the student quickly says them aloud in English.
5. If it's clear that the student is poorly prepared, stumbles, makes mistakes and thinks before answering, they are sent to prepare the lesson again, until they can answer quickly without hesitation.

The main function of the Helper is to create additional motivation, establish regular study habits, and train the Student. The application provides knowledge in the most digestible form.
