# ðŸ“‹ Methodology: Learning English Through Natural Acquisition

This textbook is developed based on the principle of **natural language acquisition**, similar to how children learn. Instead of burdening you with complex grammatical rules and terminology, we allow you to **intuitively understand** the language through practice and repetition.

## Key advantages:

1. **No complex grammatical explanations** â€” you learn rules through examples, as in natural acquisition of your native language
2. **Gradual increase in complexity** â€” each lesson builds on the previous one, ensuring smooth progress
3. **Clear transcription in two languages** â€” you always know how to pronounce words correctly
4. **Minimal information blocks** â€” you easily absorb material in small portions
5. **Focus on practical application** â€” you immediately start building sentences and using the language

## Textbook structure (each lesson):

1. one rule
2. 10 new words
3. exercises for practice and repetition

## Who is this methodology for:

- **Beginners** â€” the perfect start without information overload
- **Those who struggle** with traditional learning methods
- **People with a practical mindset** â€” you immediately apply what you learn
- **Busy people** â€” easy, short lessons
- **Those who cannot read** - you can listen and repeat
- **Anyone who wants to understand the language intuitively**, rather than memorizing rules

## Results:

After completing the entire course, you will be able to:

- **Speak on various topics**
- **Understand spoken language**
- **Have a solid foundation**

**Start speaking English naturally, without memorizing rules!**
