# üèãÔ∏è For the Student: How to Use the Textbook/App

## 1. Learn the words at the beginning of the lesson **QUICKLY**.

### Tips

Read, listen, repeat, and create metaphors to help you remember. For example, for the word "small" - create a mental image like "a small person fell into tar (smola in Russian)". When you have trouble remembering the word "small", you'll recall this image and remember "small" from the Russian word "smola".

First, aim to recall all words without looking anywhere (using metaphors, etc.). Practice recalling them while walking, going to the store, waiting at a bus stop, etc. After each recall session, the speed at which you retrieve the word from memory will increase.

### Testing (choose what works for you)

1. Quickly say all the lesson words by yourself
2. Write the words quickly on paper
3. Have someone randomly say words in your language, and you quickly say them in English

If you can't do it quickly and without mistakes - **keep studying until you can do it quickly and without errors**.

The first few lessons may be very difficult to complete. But it gets easier each time. By lesson 10, you'll be able to effectively memorize words after just a few readings.

## 2. Read, listen, and translate sentences for reinforcement.

After learning the words, thoughtfully read the sentences and translate them. Pay attention to word order and differences between your language and English.

### Testing

1. Think of a phrase in your language and say it in English
2. Have someone randomly say sentences from the "Translation" section, and you instantly translate them into English

## Results

**Memorizing QUICKLY is the guarantee of successful language learning in a short time**.

- By completing 1 lesson per day, you'll have good language skills in 2-3 months.
- If completing 2 lessons per week, you'll achieve this in a year.

If you don't learn words "quickly", you won't learn the language even after years of study.
