# üßë‚Äçüíª Teacher and Technology. Less Workload and Requirements

The role of a teacher in a student's learning process can be divided into:

1. **Competence and deep knowledge** ‚Äî professional mastery of the subject
2. **Motivation through interaction** ‚Äî ability to engage and maintain student interest

Even with perfect knowledge sources (YouTube lessons, books, etc.), most people struggle with independent study. But when they know that another person will check their progress and participate with them in the learning process, they mobilize: carefully prepare for lessons, work with concentration, and show greater dedication.

## The Social Nature of Learning

In psychology, there is a concept: "we think about each other." Many thought processes and emotional states arise when interacting with other people.

The learning process is not only about transferring information but also social interaction that creates the necessary emotional background for effective knowledge acquisition.

## How Technology Changes the Teacher's Role

Our application reduces the requirements for teacher competence, allowing them to focus on the motivational role.

The application completely takes over the function of pronouncing words and sentences. The teacher doesn't need to repeat phrases many times until the student understands the pronunciation. The student simply clicks on words and phrases, listens and repeats as much as needed. They look at translations, transcription, etc., on their own.

## Who Can Take on the Role of a Teacher?

Thanks to technology, someone from the student's environment can take on the role of a teacher:

- Parents
- Brothers and sisters
- Friends

Such a teacher-motivator:

- inspires the student, noting their efforts and moments where they did well
- maintains discipline and regularity of classes
- identifies common mistakes and draws the student's attention to them
- scolds for poor preparation and laziness

## Professional Teacher

At the initial stage of mastering the first thousand words and key grammatical rules (without nuances and exceptions), the main role is played by the student's motivation and discipline, regularity of classes, and a sense of success in each lesson. Our program provides all this to the student.

A professional teacher will also benefit greatly from the application and methodology if they change their approach from traditional textbooks. The teacher just needs to listen carefully to the student, note strengths and weaknesses, and provide quality feedback on the material. If the student doesn't understand something from the application - explain it in other words.

By structuring work in this way, the teacher can take on more students by reducing the workload that the application handles. Quickly bring them to confident mastery of the language foundation. Students will move confidently; success through small, easy lessons will reduce the likelihood of quitting.

Having many students with a good initial base, when they understand speech by ear, speak, and know many words, the teacher can delve into the subtleties of grammar, preparing them for more advanced, professional language proficiency.
